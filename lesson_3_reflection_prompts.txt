When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   You would want to use a remote repository in that case when you want to develop/share software or something  by collaborating with multiple people from different locations, 
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Your local repository might be in intermediate state of work and you wouldn't want to get into messy state by syncing with the remote repository unless you are ready to do.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is like creating a new branch from existing branch. Cloning is like creating a mirror image, copying all pieces of data including the meta-data from the remote repository. Brances are for to carry out experiment on a stable version of code to add new features or to modify existing functionality for some reasons like re-factoring. Once experiment is successful with respect to complete functionality, branched code can be merged back to main branch. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So it will be easy to keep updated the local repository as early as possible by merging with the remote copy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    SVN or similar software like Clearcase. I think GitHub is a more evolved concept over cloud storage for effective and fast collaboration with multiple people across the world. I am not aware of SVN having a counterpart like GitHub for effective hosting, caching contributions of all account holders and allowing selective contributions to be merged into the main repository for access to share-holders. Also GitHub provides features to directly add to repository from the primary account itself that would get accessible to the share-holders on their demand.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
